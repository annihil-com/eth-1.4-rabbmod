6) FAQ
----------------------

I can't compile eth
- Read installation instructions in this manual and check requirements. If you're still
  unable to compile the bot yourself - use precombiled libETH.so and eth.pk3

I can't open the console, why?
- I don't know why, but i've noticed this on some distros. If the standard "~" key doesen't
  work, you'll have to toggle your console by pressing ALTGR + 1. I don't know if there is
  a solution to get this to normal. In case there is - notify us and we'll post it here.

My global/team/fireteam popup doesn't work!
- You've probably forgot to copy eth.pk3 to your ~/.etwolf/etmain/ folder. eth is using a
  modified chat window which is inside eth.pk3 and won't load the one located in game's pk3 files.

Medicbot is doing crazy things
- It's still in an early test version, don't be surprised if you find a bug in it

Punkbuster is kicking me for eth_ cvars!
- eth >= 1.0 doesn't use cvars. You've probably used the old eth which inserted cvars into your config file(s). You can edit your config files by hand and remove all eth_ cvars or as a faster solution you can delete all configs from your ~/.etwolf/
